This template builds, trains, and tunes an SVM for a **classification** problem. If you would like to learn more about SVMs, take a look at DataCamp's [Linear Classifiers in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/linear-classifiers-in-python) course.\n\nTo swap in your dataset in this template, the following is required:\n- There must be at least one feature column and a column with a categorical target variable you would like to predict.\n- The features have been cleaned and preprocessed, including categorical encoding.\n- There are no NaN/NA values. You can use [this template to impute missing values](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/templates/recipe-python-impute-missing-data) if needed.\n\nThe placeholder dataset in this template is consists of hotel booking data with details, such as length of stay. Each row represents a booking and whether the booking was canceled (the target variable). You can find more information on this dataset's source and dictionary [here](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/datasets/dataset-python-hotel-booking-demand).","metadata":{},"id":"27be9347-9e6f-4811-a1eb-b09638bbb272","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### 1.
